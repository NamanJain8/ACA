# ACA Project-Network Security
##### *Mentor*- *Nikhil Vanjani*
Project was aimed at understanding various Network Technologies, learning and implementing PHP , understanding various types of network attacks and basics of cryptography.

The project progressed in 4 phases:
* **Network Technologies** - In this we viewed NPTEL Lectures(1-20) on Newtork Technologies which comprised of:
  * Layering in Networks
  * Network and Routing Protocols
  * HTML, XML, CGI Scripts
* **Learning Python**
  * Learned PHP and mySQL from Lynda.

  * Made a web-app WidgetCorp using basic PHP and mySQL and hosted it. In web-app, an authorised user can modify its content while an unauthorised user can only view its content.

* **Familiarised with Network Attacks**
  * We learned about various attacks like DDos, MITM and top 10 OWASP attacks.
  * Implemented some of them on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

* **Familiarisation with Cryptography**
  * Understood basics of cryptography
  * Understood RSA algorithm- **RSA** is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. There are two different keys.One is Public key which is visible to everyone other one is Private key.  It utilises concepts from Number Theory. It is based on the fact that finding the factors of an integer is hard (the factoring problem).
